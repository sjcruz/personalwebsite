abstract: Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are increasingly exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climatic shocks, which contribute to high interannual and seasonal variability in catch and income. Diversification across species, space, and time as a means of reducing risk and uncertainty is well documented in fisheries, though there is little empirical evidence in open-access systems. Literature on diversification across non-fishing industries is more limited. In developing countries, agriculture, a similar climate-sensitive sector, studies show that climate variability has led to various outcomes, such as income loss, labor reallocation, and migration. Similar impacts could be anticipated in fishing communities, affecting their ability to diversify and adapt to climate variability. Here, I estimate the effect of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major source of global climate variability, on fishery landings, ex-vessel revenue, and household income in small-scale fishing municipalities in Mexico from 2006-2020. Results indicate that ENSO, a 1Â°C anomaly of either warming or cooling, decreases diversification of fishery landings and ex-vessel revenue, while increasing average total landings, ex-vessel revenue, and household fishing income by 7%, 9%, and 10%, respectively. This highlights the importance of specialization as an adaptive strategy. On the other hand, income from non-fishing industries becomes more diversified during ENSO events, despite falling overall by 18% on average. Income from industries like construction, manufacturing, and agriculture decreases during warming events. Households compensate with non-labor income from sources such as informal loans and savings. The open-access, multi-gear, and multi-species nature of SSF allows fishers the ability to opportunistically shift target fisheries, potentially reducing labor reallocation to non-fishing industries. Alternatively, these industries are also negatively impacted by ENSO, and the lack of climate-resilient alternatives underscores the importance of fishing income in SSF households.
