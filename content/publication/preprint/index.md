abstract: Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are increasingly exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climatic shocks, which contribute to high interannual and seasonal variability in catch and income. Diversification across species, space, and time as a means of reducing risk and uncertainty is well documented in fisheries, though there is little empirical evidence in open-access systems. Literature on diversification across non-fishing industries is more limited. In developing countries, agriculture, a similar climate-sensitive sector, studies show that climate variability has led to various outcomes, such as income loss, labor reallocation, and migration. Similar impacts could be anticipated in fishing communities, affecting their ability to diversify and adapt to climate variability. Here, pair household labor and fishery production data to estimate the effect of El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major source of global climate variability, on small-scale fishing municipalities in Mexico from 2006-2020. 
\
Preliminary results indicate that both La Ni&ntilde;a (periods of cooling) and El Ni&ntilde;o (periods of warming) result in a specialization of fishery production, decrease in diversification and an increase in production. Household income increases during La Nina, as fishing and non-labor (savings and informal loans)  income increases. The latter might suggest households are investing in fishing during this time. During El Ni&ntilde;o non-fishing income decreases and total household income becomes less diversified. I hypothesize that the open-access, multi-gear, and multi-species nature of SSF allows fishers the ability to opportunistically shift target fisheries to “winners” which in turn lowers the opportunity cost of fishing and thus reduces labor reallocation to non-fishing industries. These results suggest that while diversification is important for risk reduction, the ability to specialize is an important adaptation strategy to increase income.

summary: Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are increasingly exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climatic shocks, which contribute to high interannual and seasonal variability in catch and income. Here I explore adaptation strategies withing small-scale fishing communities.
