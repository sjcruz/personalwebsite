abstract: Fisheries are increasingly exposed to numerous natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climatic variability, that contribute to high interannual and seasonal variability of catch and income. Adaptive strategies, such as diversifying fish stocks harvested and reallocating labor between fishing and non-fishing activities, can reduce risk and stabilize income. However, the role of labor reallocation has received little empirical attention. This study examines the impact of the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on labor allocation, income, and fishery production in small-scale fishing municipalities in Mexico from 2006 to 2022. Contrary to expectations, fishers reduce the diversity of catch and increase their reliance on fishing rather than reallocating labor to non-fishing sectors during ENSO events. This behavior is driven by the low cost of switching between fish species and the low opportunity cost of fishing, given factors such as limited alternative employment opportunities, low educational attainment, and the rural nature of these communities. While diversification is often seen as beneficial, specialization increases fishery production in this context, leading to negligible or positive impacts on household income. These findings highlight the role of specialization as an adaptive strategy that can buffer fishing communities from the economic impacts of climate variability.
