Welcome to my site! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Birkenbach-Oremus Lab](https://birkenbach-oremus-lab.github.io/website/) at the University of Delaware. My research focuses on the intersection of natural resource and development economics, climate change, and fisheries management. I use econometric techniques and bioeconomic modeling to explore human-ocean interactions in the face of climate change.
